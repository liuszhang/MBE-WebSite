                  <p>The Model Based Enterprise (MBE) website is a collaborative effort to provide you with an overview of what is going on in the area of 3D annotated models, Model Based Definition and Technical Data Packages as a single source model throughout the lifecycle of a product along with other areas in what is becoming known as the Digital Tapestry.<br>
</p>
                  <p>Our team has joined together to provide a comprehensive resource to help educate and guide others in the area of MBE.  Our goal is to help others become more educated about MBE by showing how it can impact their design, manufacturing and sustainment cultures. With the release of MIL-STD-31000A, MBE is fast becoming the future of the DoD supply chain.<br>
