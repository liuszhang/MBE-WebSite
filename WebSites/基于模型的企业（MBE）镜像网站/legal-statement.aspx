By using this Web Site you agree that under no circumstances will the Company, or any of its members, advertisers sponsors or affiliates or the partners, agents, or employees thereof be liable to you or anyone else for (1) any information contained in or omitted from this Web Site, (2) any person's reliance on such information whether or not the information is correct, current or complete (3) any decision made or action taken in reliance on the information in this Web Site or for any consequential, special, or similar damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

                            Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, The Company cannot and does not confirm that each user is who they claim to be.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code d1542, which says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot;
