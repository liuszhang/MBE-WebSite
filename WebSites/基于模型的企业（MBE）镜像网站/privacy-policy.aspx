                        <p>
                            MBE respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its Web site. MBE strongly believes that if electronic commerce and online activities are to flourish, Users must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, MBE has implemented the following policy.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What Information Does MBE Collect?</strong><br>
                            Most data MBE collects are used only to help MBE better serve its members. It is our general policy to collect and store only personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide. If our privacy policies change, we will notify all Users by e-mail or a special announcement placed on the Web site.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>From General Users. </strong>MBE does not collect any personal information from Users browsing its Web site. Users to the public areas of MBE's Web site browse anonymously. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page--are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>From MBE Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Customers. </strong>To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on the MBE Web site, members and other Users are asked to register and provide some limited information. These data are submitted voluntarily. MBE asks Users to provide their name, member number (for members), organization name, business phone, and e-mail. Similar information may be submitted to MBE through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions, and contest registrations.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How Does MBE Use Data Collected?</strong><br>
                            MBE uses information voluntarily submitted by members and other customers in the following ways:<br>
                            MBE Member Services and Products. Generally, MBE and its direct subsidiaries use data collected to improve its own Web content; to respond to visitors' interests, needs and preferences; and to develop new products and services.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Disclosures to Third Parties. </strong>MBE also makes member contact information available through a Directory to other members using its Web site and to those who register for meetings and conferences that it sponsors. In addition, MBE incorporates information Users provide into hard copies of a Directory that it provides to members and may sell to requesters. On occasion, MBE may also provide limited data to third parties that offer products and services. These limited data include names, job titles, companies and business addresses, but do not include business e-mail addresses. Users may request MBE to refrain from disclosing the data it collects to third parties on the website, meeting or conference registration forms or any other form on which they are providing information; an opt-out box will appear on each form on which a User provides information. Alternatively, Users may contact MBE at <a href="mailto:info@catalystconnection.org" target="_new">info@catalystconnection.org</a> or 412.918.4300 to express their preferences if they determine later that they do not wish to have the information shared.<br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Credit Card Account Information. </strong>MBE does not disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, MBE submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate clearinghouse.<br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>How Does MBE Use Cookies?</strong><br>
                            Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a User's hard disk for use either during a particular session (&quot;per-session&quot; cookie) or for future use (&quot;persistent&quot; cookie). MBE uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, determine appropriate solicitations, and review navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about Users over the Internet or to analyze any information that Users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. When a User registers, the system will ask whether the User approves of the attachment of a cookie. Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a &quot;persistent&quot; cookie and rather accept only a &quot;per-session&quot; cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the site to enjoy the full benefits. If the User declines the attachment of any cookie, the User may not have access to the full benefits of the website. Registration enables the site to better determine members' interest areas and provide the most relevant information.<br>

                            <strong>What about information from children?</strong><br>
                            MBE does not intend to collect information from children. MBE is committed to the safety of children and we do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from children under age 18.
